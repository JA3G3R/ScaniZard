# Scanizard

**Scanizard** is a security-focused, AI-powered static analysis tool designed to detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and automation workflows.  
It supports a wide range of declarative formats, including:

- Terraform  
- GitHub Actions  
- AWS CloudFormation  
- Kubernetes YAMLs  

---

## ðŸš€ Features

### **Risk Detection Engine**

Scanizard uses a **hybrid scanning engine** combining:

#### **Static Rule-Based Scanners**
Detects common security flaws such as:
- Public S3 buckets  
- Over-permissive IAM roles  
- Open security groups  
- Missing encryption  
- Unsafe shell commands (`curl | bash`, `eval`, etc.)  
- Hardcoded secrets or credential leaks  
- Dangerous or untrusted GitHub Actions (`uses: someone/unknown@latest`)  

#### **LLM-Backed Contextual Analysis**
Performs deeper semantic checks:
- Detecting when secrets are exposed to logs  
- Misuse of environment variables  
- Insecure conditional logic in workflows

## ðŸ“„ Output

Scanizard produces **JSON** and **Markdown** reports containing:

- File & line number of the finding  
- Severity score (Low, Medium, High, Critical)  
- Risk category (Misconfiguration, Vulnerability, Secret Leak, etc.)  
- Suggested remediation steps  

Example JSON output:
```json
{
  "file": "main.tf",
  "line": 14,
  "severity": "High",
  "rule": "Overly permissive IAM policy",
  "recommendation": "Restrict actions to only those required for the resource."
}
```

## âš™ Supported Commands

```bash
./scanizard terraform   # Scan Terraform configurations
./scanizard github      # Scan GitHub Actions workflows
./scanizard kubernetes  # Scan Kubernetes YAMLs
./scanizard cloudformation  # Scan AWS CloudFormation templates
./scanizard all         # Scan everything in a given folder
```

## ðŸ“‘ Reporting & Integrations

- **Markdown & JSON reports** for human-readable and machine-parsable results  
- Integrates easily into **CI/CD pipelines**  
- Can fail builds on high/critical severity findings
